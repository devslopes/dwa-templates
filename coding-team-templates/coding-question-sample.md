The Images Gallery assignment. The "Modern Design" image doesn't show up on the main page, the broken image icon and alternative text appears instead.

> Which environment did you use to work on the project/assignment/code?

- VSCode

> Did you check spelling of attributes, elements, methods, arguments? (Y/N):

Yes. I double checked attributes spelling in the img HTML element documentation.

> Do you have the recommended set of VSCode extensions installed? (Y/N):

Yes.

> Did you check the code in the VSCode IDE W3C Web validator extension or the online W3C validator? (Y/N):

Yes.

> Did you fix the validation errors? (Y/N):

Yes. No errors found.

> Did you search through past questions (posts) in the channel to find the same problem? (Provide links to the threads that are similar to your issue)

I found a thread with the images display error that is close to my problem. I double checked the path to image and it's all correct.

> Did you visit the element/method/topic documentation page? (Provide a link to specific documentation page)

Yes I visited the "img" HTML element documentation page at MDN but none of the tips from that page solved my issue. The syntax of the element and the attributes are matching the docs page: [img](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)

> Did you try prompting google? What did you find out? (Provide links to pages you found in google that include the ways to solve your problem)

I found the following stackoverflow thread: [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38930893/image-is-not-displaying-in-my-browser-it-shows-only-alt-value), but my element's code seems to have valid syntax.

> Did you join the mentorâ€™s call to get help on that issue? (Y/N)

I joined Eric's meetup yesterday, and we touched on the docs page an the folders naming in the path. I synced all the folder names but it didn't solve my problem.

> Identify the Goal/What You Want to Happen

The image should show up in the "Modern Design" card on the main page.

> Identify the Problem or Obstacle You are Facing

The broken image icon and the alternative text appears instead.

> What Do You Think the Root Cause of the Blocker/Problem Is?

I had an assumption it has to do with attribute name spelling, but it seem to NOT be a reason.
The other assumption I had was about the folder names in the path or the file name, but they all are correct. It has to be something with the path.

> What Potential Solutions Have You Tried? What Was The Result?

I tried reordering the attributes in the opening tag but following the documentation and the HTML element anatomy lesson the order shouldn't matter. More than that other images show up with the same order of attributes.
