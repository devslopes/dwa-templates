### TEMPLATE Requirements and examples

!!! HINT: Even if the question is a Yes/No one, always try to add relative context to help others help you better.

#### Use a Clear and Descriptive Post Title

> [ Start the post title with the ASSIGNMENT NAME and a short, professional description of the problem. ]

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: "My links don't work!"
- ❌ Bad: "MyTube link don't work"
- ✅ Great: "MyTube HTML: The "a" anchor HTML Element doesn’t redirect me to a proper destination from the href attribute value when the link is clicked."

#### Confirming the Development Environment You Are Using

> [ Which environment did you use to work on the project/assignment/code? ]

`Remove those that don't apply...`

VSCode  
Stackblitz online IDE
Other IDE or text editor

Remove the items that you DID NOT use. If your answer is NOT VSCode you will be asked to move your code to VSCode and try to resolve your issue there first using available helpers and extensions.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: Notepad (or any other default text editor)
- ✅ Great: VSCode (or any other IDE set to work with HTML, CSS, JS, in other words dedicated to web development)

#### Basic Validation and Debugging Checks

Answer YES or NO to the following:

> Did you check spelling of attributes, elements, methods, arguments? (Y/N)

If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked to check the spelling first. Try to utilize the “Code Spell Checker” VSCode extension.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ✅ Not Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ✅ Great: Yes. I have no spelling errors in my code, checked both by the "code spell checker extension" and the "W3C Web Validator" extension.

> [ Do you have the recommended set of VSCode extensions installed? (Y/N) ]

HTML&CSS issues: If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked to install the recommended set of tools and use the helpers to use them and try to resolve your issue first.

Please follow along with the software setup section of the Curriculum (Orientation) to have all the software and VSCode extensions installed and set.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ✅ Not Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ✅ Great: Yes. I have all the recommended VSCode extensions installed, including the W3C Web validator extension.

> [ Did you check the code in the VSCode IDE W3C Web validator extension or the online W3C validator? (Y/N) ]

HTML&CSS issues: If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked to check the code in the validator first.

Examples

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ✅ Not Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ✅ Great: Yes. I had two issues highlighted with the "W3C validator", I fixed them all now I don't have any errors validating the document but it didn't solve my issue.

> [ Did you fix the validation errors? (Y/N) ]

HTML&CSS issues: If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked to fix the errors first.

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ✅ Not Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ✅ Great: Yes. The W3C Web validator doesn't show me any errors when validating the document.

#### What Resources Have You Used Already?

> [ Did you search through past questions (posts) in the channel to find the same problem? (Provide links to the threads that are similar to your issue) ]

If your answer is YES, Please provide the link/links to the threads you read through in your answer or the one that helps that touches your issue but might not include the answer to your problem or the answer didn't help to resolve the question.

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ❌ Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ✅ Great: Yes. I read through the "Anchor" element documentation page at MDN: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)

> [ Did you try prompting google? What did you find out? (Provide links to pages you found in google that include the ways to solve your problem) ]

If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked make google search first.

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ❌ Bad: Yes. I visited stackoverflow and some other resources.
- ✅ Great: Yes. I think the solution of my problem might be discussed in this Stackoverflow thread, but neither og the solutions on this page helped me to solve the issue: [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27131773/my-links-arent-working-should-be-simple-fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27131773/my-links-arent-working-should-be-simple-fix)

> [ Did you join the mentor’s call to get help on that issue? (Y/N) ]

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ❌ Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ❌ Bad: Yes, But I was late, so there was no time for the mentor to help me.
- ❌ Bad: Yes, but I wasn't confident enough to as my stupid question.
- ❌ Bad: Yes, but there were so many questions and I was too shy to push mine in the middle or to type my question in the zoom chat.
- ✅ Good: Yes, I joined <mentor_name>'s call and we discussed the way I can resolve my issue which was to check the spelling of my attributes. I checked them all and they are all correct, but it didn't help me to resolve the issue.

#### Structure Your Question

##### Identify the Goal/What You Want to Happen

> [ Briefly explain the desired behavior and outcome you expect to happen. ]

HTML&CSS: Feel free to use screenshots with DETAILED explanation of the expected result or/and the Excalidraw with the expected result visuals.

Excalidraw Url: [Link](https://excalidraw.com/)

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: Screenshot attached.
- ✅ Good:

  I want the block that contains the words "My BIO" to take the full width of the Browser viewport.

  Here is the Loom video URL where I explain how I want the block to act.

- ✅ Good:

  I want the block that contains the words "My BIO" to take the full width of the Browser viewport.

  Here is the excalidraw link where I demonstrate how I want the block with "My BIO" act in the Browser.

##### Identify the Problem or Obstacle You are Facing

> [ Briefly explain what is happening instead of what you want to happen. ]

Your task in this section is to explain what is going against your expectations. We strongly recommend recording a loom video (or any other screen recording service that let you share the video URL) demonstrating the circumstances the error happens under. This will let mentors and community members reproduce the problem to help you faster.

Feel free to record a single loom video that cover both the "Identify the Goal/What You Want to Happen" and "Identify the Problem or Obstacle You are Facing" sections.

HTML&CSS issues: Make sure to show the inspector and the rendered version of the problematic part to demonstrate your attempt to resolve the issue with the dev tools of the Browser.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: Screenshot attached.
- ✅ Good:

  The problem is that the block that contains the words "My BIO" won't take the full width of the Browser viewport. It's width only wraps the content instead.

  Here is the Loom video URL where I explain how I want the block to act, and how it acts instead.

- ✅ Good:

  The problem is that the block that contains the words "My BIO" won't take the full width of the Browser viewport. It's width only wraps the content instead.

  In the attached screenshot/excalidraw page I demonstrate the way my page acts at the moment.

##### What Do You Think the Root Cause of the Blocker/Problem Is?

> [ Share an educated guess as to why you think the problem is occurring. ]

If you don't know the reason, please make guesses and assumptions. Do your best to test them before you continue. One of them might be a correct one to help you resolve the issue.

If you don't add any assumptions or guesses you will be asked to spend some time to think where the issue might be and then update your post.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No idea.
- ❌ Bad: I don't know.
- ✅ Good:

  I think since the W3C Web validator tool doesn't show any errors, which means that my HTML is all valid the issue might only be in the value of the href attribute or another missing attribute, but I don't see any issue there. The href attribute is the only one that sets the path for the browser to follow once clicked.

##### What Potential Solutions Have You Tried? What Was The Result?

> [ List any solutions you have tried and their result. Did they partially fix the problem, create new bugs, or not work at all? ]

Please add screenshots or a loom video that will help the mentor/ community member reproduce the same error on their side. Don’t use the screenshots of the code. Share your code professionally in the proper section of the questionnaire.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ❌ Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ❌ Bad: I don't know what should I do.
- ✅ Good:

  I tried to refactor the href attribute value to include "http":

  ```html
  <a href="http:/some-project-url.com"></a>
  ```

  But it didn't help. Checkout the first screenshot attached where I demonstrate the result.

  Then I tried to change the protocol to be a secure one, but it didn't work either:

  ```html
  <a href="https:/some-project-url.com"></a>
  ```

#### Show Us Your Code

> [ Share your code professionally (GitHub repo URL, StackBlitz project URL, Code snippet with syntax highlighting.) ]
