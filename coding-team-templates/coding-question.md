If your answer is YES, Please provide the link to the threads you read through in your answer or the one that helps that touches your issue but might not include the answer to your problem or the answer didn't help to resolve the question.

If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked to search through the older posts. If the question you asked is being repeated it might be deleted by a mentor.

Examples:

  Yes. I didn't find any posts that cover the issue I have.

- ✅ Good: 
  
  Yes.

  This thread looks similar to my problem, but the solution didn't fix my problem: [https://discord.com/channels/747547219586056295/1315752477655699537](https://discord.com/channels/747547219586056295/1315752477655699537)


> [ Description of the problem ]

Your task in this section is to explain what is going against your expectations. We strongly recommend recording a loom video (or any other screen recording service that let you share the video URL) demonstrating the circumstances the error happens under. This will let mentors and community members reproduce the problem to help you faster.

HTML&CSS: You can also use screenshots with DETAILED explanation of the expected result vs what is on the screenshot and the Excalidraw with the expected result visuals.

Excalidraw Url: [Link](https://excalidraw.com/)

HTML&CSS issues: Make sure to show the inspector and the rendered version of the problematic part to demonstrate your attempt to resolve the issue with the dev tools of the Browser.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: Screenshot attached.
- ✅ Good:

  The problem is that the block that contains the words "My BIO" won't take the full width of the Browser viewport. It's width only wraps the content instead.

  Here is the Loom video URL where I explain how I want the block to act, and how it acts instead.

- ✅ Good: 

    The problem is that the block that contains the words "My BIO" won't take the full width of the Browser viewport. It's width only wraps the content instead.

    In the attached screenshot I demonstrate the way my page acts at the moment.

    Here is the excalidraw link where I demonstrate how I want the block with "My BIO" act in the Browser.

> [ What do you think is a reason of the issue? ]

If you don't know make guesses and assumptions. Do your best to test them before you continue. One of them might be a correct one to help you resolve the issue. 

If you don't add any assumptions or guesses you will be asked to spend some time to think where the issue might be and then update your post.

Examples: 

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No idea.
- ❌ Bad: I don't know.
- ✅ Good:

  I think since the W3C Web validator tool doesn't show any errors, which means that my HTML is all valid the issue might only be in the value of the href attribute or another missing attribute, but I don't see any issue there. The href attribute is the only one that sets the path for the browser to follow once clicked.

> [ Which environment did you use to work on the project/assignment/code? ]

VSCode  
Codepen  
Notepad  

Remove the items that you DID NOT use. If your answer is NOT VSCode you will be asked to move your code to VSCode and try to resolve your issue there first using available helpers and extensions.

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: Codepen (or any other online IDE)
- ❌ Bad: Notepad (or any other default text editor)
- ✅ Good: VSCode (or any other local IDE set to work with HTML, CSS, JS, in other words dedicated to web development)

> [ Do you have the recommended set of extensions installed? (Y/N) ]

HTML&CSS issues: If your answer to this question is NO you will be asked to install the recommended set of tools and use the helpers to use them and try to resolve your issue first.

- ✅ Good: Yes. I have no spelling errors in my code, checked both by the "code spell checker extension" and the "W3C Web Validator" extension.

> [ Did you check the code in the VSCode IDE W3C Web validator extension or the online W3C validator? Y/N. ]

I also asked ChatGPT for help with the following prompt: "What could be possible reasons for the "a" anchor HTML Element to NOT let me get redirected to a proper destination from the href attribute value when the link is clicked."

> [ What did you try? What was the expected result? What was the result in fact? Attach screenshots of the result you got for each item of what you have tried. ]

Examples:

- ❌ Bad: Empty (no answer)
- ❌ Bad: No
- ❌ Bad: Yes (single word with no context)
- ❌ Bad: I don't know what should I do.
- ✅ Good: 

  I tried to refactor the href attribute value to include "http":

  ```html
  <a href="http:/some-project-url.com">
  ```

  But it didn't help. Checkout the first screenshot attached where I demonstrate the result.

  Then I tried to change the protocol to be a secure one, but it didn't work either:

  ```html
  <a href="https:/some-project-url.com">
  ```
